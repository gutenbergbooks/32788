<h2 id="preface">PREFACE</h2>

<p class="noindent"><span class="first_word">The</span> title of this little brochure indicates its contents.
<i>Simple Tricks</i> and simple tricks only. No apparatus is
required and but little sleight-of-hand is needed in the
performance of any of them. They consist of a series of
tricks and problems, easily acquired, suitable for gatherings
round the table on winter evenings. Some of them are
new and many are old; but even the oldest are new to the
rising generation. For six of the latest tricks,—“<a href="#a_hindoo_swindle">A <ins title="Note: “Hindu” in the original">Hindoo</ins>
Swindle</a>,” “<a href="#the_elusive_match-a_capital_impromptu_trick">The Elusive Match</a>,” “<a href="#a_subtle_impromptu_effect_with_a_coin">A Subtle Impromptu
Effect with a Coin</a>,” “<a href="#a_novel_card_effect">A Novel Card Effect</a>,” “<a href="#an_artful_card_force">An Artful
Card Force</a>,” and “<a href="#another_easy_card_force">Another Easy Card Force</a>,”—I am
indebted to my friend Mr. F. Walford Perry, a thoroughly
up-to-date and original young conjurer. As I have already
said, I have included no tricks which require the exercise
of much sleight-of-hand; but even the most simple trick
should be thoroughly practised before you present it to
your friends, especially those tricks which require the assistance
of a confederate. Rehearse everything with him
thoroughly beforehand. Even your “patter” should be
rehearsed. But endeavour to lead your audience to believe
that, like “Mr. Wemmick’s” marriage, it is all impromptu.
He said, “Hello! here’s a church. Let’s have a wedding.”
You say, “Hand me that serviette ring and I’ll show you
<span id="pg_6" class="page_anchor">6 </span>a trick.” If, when the contents of this little volume have
been thoroughly digested, my readers desire to make a
study of more advanced legerdemain, I recommend my
<i>Conjuring Up to Date</i>, <i>Card Tricks with and without
Apparatus</i>, and <i>Latest Sleights and Illusions</i> to their notice.</p>

<p>For tricks which require apparatus my readers cannot do
better than to send to Messrs. Hamley Bros., Ltd., 35, New
Oxford Street, or one of their branches, for their Magical
Catalogue.</p>

<p><i>The Daily Telegraph</i>, in a recent article on “Magic Fifty
Years Ago,” used these words: “Hamleys’ were then, as
they are now, the premier manufacturers of magical
apparatus.” A statement which I cordially endorse. The
apparatus sold by Messrs. Hamley Bros. is invariably
reliable.</p>

<p>In conclusion I beg to offer my readers the following
advice:—</p>

<p>Never state the nature of the trick you are about to
perform.</p>

<p>Make it a rule never to repeat a trick the same evening
unless you have acquired a different way of showing it.
In fact, it is advisable to learn several methods of presenting
the same trick.</p>

<p>Talk as much as possible and make your “patter” lively,
but do not try to be funny unless you are naturally humorous;
and, above all, avoid allusions to politics, religion, or
any subject about which there may be a diversity of opinion
among your audience.</p>

SELECTED CARD</h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="first_word">Throw</span> the pack on the table and request <ins title="Note: “someone” in the original">some one</ins> to
select a card. Then gather up the rest of the cards and
request your friend to show his card to his neighbour, to
avoid mistakes. While this is being done bend the pack
slightly while pretending to shuffle it, and cause the card
to be returned and the pack shuffled. The selected card
can then be easily detected among the bent cards by its
being perfectly straight. A good way to finish the trick is
to bring the card to the top of the pack and cause it to
project about an inch over the right side; cover the front end
of the pack with your four fingers so that the edge of the projecting
card is concealed, and, with your thumb at the other
end, hold the pack firmly about eighteen inches above the
table. Request the person who drew the card to call it by
name. On this being done, drop the pack on the table,
when the projecting card will be completely turned over by
the air in its descent and lie perfectly square on the top of
the pack. Another good finish is to bring the chosen
card to the bottom of the pack, and requesting the person
who selected it to hold the pack by pinching it tightly
between his finger and thumb close to the corner, you give
<span id="pg_10" class="page_anchor">10 </span>the pack a sharp rap, when all the cards will fall excepting
the one chosen.</p>

BOTTOM OF THE PACK AT ANY NUMBER
REQUESTED</h3>

<p>Ask a member of the company to take a card, look at it,
and return it to the pack. Make the “pass” (<i>Hercat’s Card
Tricks</i>, p. 7); “palm” the card (<i>Card Tricks</i>, p. 18)
and hand the pack to be shuffled. While this is being
done transfer the palmed card to your left hand, and on
receiving the pack back, place it over the concealed card,
and tell the company you will produce the latter from the
bottom of the pack at any number they may name. Supposing
some one says, “Let it be the fifteenth card.” You
push the pack forward in your left hand, allowing the
bottom card to project about an inch toward you, and
proceed to draw out the cards above it with your right
hand, one at a time, until the fourteenth is reached, when
you push the bottom card forward and produce it as the
fifteenth.</p>

<h3 id="a_chosen_card_shaken_through_a_handkerchief">A CHOSEN CARD SHAKEN THROUGH A
HANDKERCHIEF</h3>

<p>Request a member of the company to select a card and
return it to the pack, which you proceed to wrap up in
a large pocket handkerchief, and on the person calling the
card by name you shake the handkerchief and the selected
card falls on the table.</p>

<p><span class="title">Explanation.</span>—If you are not an adept at sleight-of-hand
<span id="pg_11" class="page_anchor">11 </span>it is advisable to use a “forcing pack” which is composed
of only three or four cards, of a kind (i.e. ten kings
of hearts, ten five of spades, ten eight of diamonds, etc.)
with backs to match your ordinary pack. If you can make
the “pass” and can “palm” (<i>Hercat’s Card Tricks</i>, pp. 7
and 18) the following is the correct <i>modus operandi</i>. On
the card being returned to the pack, carry it to the top by
the pass, palm it, and hand the pack back to be shuffled.
Place the palmed card face upward on the left hand and
cover it with a large white handkerchief, and cause the
pack to be placed face down on the handkerchief exactly
over the concealed card. With your right hand throw the
back hem of the handkerchief
over the pack and
with that hand grasp the
four sides underneath.
Then reverse the position
of your hands, moving the
right hand toward the right
on top and taking the left
hand away, which will leave
the selected card concealed
in the fold of the handkerchief
(<a href="#fig_1">Fig. 1</a>). Ask the
person who took the card to
name it and request it to leave the pack and pass through
the handkerchief. When he does so shake the handkerchief
gently and the card will slowly come into view.
If you use a “forcing pack” retain a duplicate of the card
you intend to force; conceal it in your left hand and proceed
as above described.</p>

<h3 id="a_selected_card_found_in_a_lighted_cigarette">A SELECTED CARD FOUND IN A
LIGHTED CIGARETTE</h3>

<p>Roll a card, say the seven of hearts, in a cigarette paper
and stuff a small piece of tobacco in each end. Have this
in one of your pockets, where it will not get crushed, ready
for palming. Previously arrange with a friend to act as
your confederate, and request him when you ask him to
select a card to take the duplicate of the one in the
cigarette. When ready to present the trick, hand the pack
to your friend and ask him to shuffle it, select any card he
likes, show it to his neighbour, replace it in the pack, and
again shuffle the latter thoroughly. While this is in progress
produce some tobacco and a cigarette paper and roll a
cigarette, which substitute for the one prepared. If you
are not an adept at palming I would suggest the following
easy method: Lay your handkerchief across your knees,
and on it place the prepared cigarette. While reaching for
a match, drop the cigarette you have just made on your lap,
as if by accident, and pick up the one containing the card.
You can afterwards pick up your handkerchief and put it
and the genuine cigarette in your pocket. You then light
the prepared cigarette and ask your friend to hand you the
pack and name his card; when he does so, tell him you will
produce the card in any place he may name.</p>

<p>By previous arrangement he must say, “In the cigarette
you are smoking.” You then pick up the pack and
“ruffle” it over the cigarette; take the latter from your
mouth, extinguish the fire, and tearing the paper in the
centre, produce the seven of hearts from it.</p>

<h3 id="a_sticking_card">A STICKING CARD</h3>

<p>Obtain a short “drawing-pin” with a small head, and
having painted the head black, stick it through the centre
of the ace of clubs. Put this in your pocket and “force”
another ace upon a member of the company. Hand the
pack to the person upon whom you have forced the card,
request him to replace it and shuffle the pack. Then take
the pack from him, and as you turn your back slip the card
with the pin through it on the top of the pack. Holding
the pack in your right hand with its face toward the palm,
ask your friend to name his card. When he does so throw
the pack sharply against the door. The top card will be held
there by the pin and the rest of the pack will fall on the
floor.</p>

<p>This trick was shown by a conjurer before the late King
Edward a few years ago, and His Majesty was reported in
the daily papers to have expressed “great surprise.”</p>

<h3 id="two_selected_cards_caught_in_the_air">TWO SELECTED CARDS CAUGHT IN
THE AIR</h3>

<p>Two cards are selected and returned to the pack, which
you then make a pretence of shuffling, taking care not to
lose sight of the chosen cards; “slip” (<i>Hercat’s Card
Tricks</i>, p. 10) one of the latter to the top of the pack and
the others to the bottom face upward. Have a small
piece of wax on your right finger and thumb and press the
pack between them. Obtain the names of the selected
cards, and then throw the pack in the air, moving your hand
away quickly, with, of course, the selected cards sticking
<span id="pg_14" class="page_anchor">14 </span>to your thumb and finger. As the cards descend thrust
your hand in among them, and then, separating your thumb
and finger, show the cards adhering to them, which you
will appear to have caught.</p>

<h3 id="an_easy_but_puzzling_trick">AN EASY BUT PUZZLING TRICK</h3>

<p>Any card may be drawn—not “forced”—and returned
to the pack. In pretending to shuffle the cards, bring the
selected card to the bottom of the pack, and then slip
another card in front of it. Show your friend this
card at the bottom and ask him if it is his. Of
course he will say “No.” Lower the pack, and with
the fingers of your left hand draw the bottom card
back about half an inch, and with your right hand
draw out the next card—which is the one chosen—and
place it face down on the table. Shuffle the pack and
again show the bottom card, “Is this your card?” “No.”
“Then I will place this one on the table”—which you do.
Repeat this, and place a third card from the bottom of the
pack on the table. Then say, “I am sure your card must
be one of the three. No? Look and see for yourself.”
He turns the three cards over, and of course finds his card
is one of them.</p>

<h3 id="travelling_cards">TRAVELLING CARDS</h3>

<p>Give the pack to a member of the company, and request
him to count off between twenty and forty cards, place the
pack on the table, and hand the cards he has counted to
you. You then hand the pile to a second person and
<span id="pg_15" class="page_anchor">15 </span>request him to count off about one-third of the number, lay
them in a pile on the table, and hand you the remainder,
which you give to the first person, requesting him to place
them in his pocket. Taking up the second pile, you request
the second person to place it in his pocket. We will suppose
the first person selected thirty and the second person
abstracted ten cards from them, which should leave twenty
now in the pocket of the former. Then announce your
intention of causing a certain number of cards to leave the
pocket of person number one and travel invisibly into the
pocket of person number two. Open a pocket-handkerchief,
and covering number one’s pocket, flick it in the
direction of person number two, exclaiming, “They have
gone!” On the two piles being produced and counted,
those from the pocket of number one person will number
only fifteen, and the same number will be found in the
second pile.</p>

<p><span class="title">Explanation.</span>—When you receive the thirty cards from
the first person, you palm off five or six cards (the number
is immaterial) and retain them concealed in your hand,
handing the remainder to the second person. When he
has counted off ten and placed them on the table, you take
those that are left from him and hand them to person
number one. When picking up the pile of ten from the
table, while pretending to square it, you add the palmed
cards and hand the pile thus increased to person number
two. You must be careful not to allow the two persons to
count the cards after the changes have been made. If you
see they are inclined to do so, take the piles from them and
place them in their pockets yourself.</p>

<span id="pg_16" class="page_anchor">16 </span>

<h3 id="to_name_all_the_cards_in_the_pack">TO NAME ALL THE CARDS IN THE PACK</h3>

<p>Ask some one to shuffle the pack, and, on receiving it
back, glance at the bottom card. Put the pack behind
your back, and then turn the top card round with its face
toward you; bring the pack in front of you, the bottom
card facing the audience and the turned card facing
you. Having already glanced at the bottom card, you can
tell them its name, and you now know the card on top.
Put the pack behind you again, and move the top card to
the front, and turn the one now on top round. Again hold
the pack up and name the front card, at the same time
noting the card facing you. By repeating this process you
can name all the cards in the pack. Take care to have all
your audience in front of you, or the turned card will be
seen.</p>

<h3 id="a_new_method">A NEW METHOD</h3>

<p>Here is an absolutely new method of performing the
same trick blindfolded, but with the aid of a confederate.
You tell your friends that by placing your hands on a
person’s head you can see with his eyes. To illustrate
this, tell your assistant to seat himself at a table, and you
then stand behind him blindfolded, with your fingers
lightly touching his temples. The cards are spread out
faces down on the table, and no matter which card he picks
up and looks at, you at once say what it is. Of course,
you take the tip from him; but how? I will tell you.</p>

<p>He must keep his mouth shut and his teeth together.
The slightest pressure between his upper and lower teeth—so
slight that it is quite imperceptible—will cause his
<span id="pg_17" class="page_anchor">17 </span>temples to throb—try it on your own temples—and, of
course, by the arrangement of a very simple code he can
communicate to you the name of each card. Say one
throb stands for hearts, two for diamonds, three for clubs,
and four for spades. We will say his temples throb twice.
You say, “You are looking at a diamond.” Then we will
suppose they next throb five times. You say, “It is the
five of diamonds,” and so on. When you come to an ace,
of course one throb will suffice; when he picks up a
knave, let him give two throbs in rapid succession—a
kind of postman’s knock; a queen, a postman’s knock and
one throb over; and for a king, a double postman’s knock—rat-tat,
rat-tat. With a little practice and a more elaborate
code, you can describe all kinds of articles which may be
selected—keys, watches, books, etc. It is a capital trick
and one which no one can possibly discover.</p>

<h3 id="the_sense_of_touch">THE SENSE OF TOUCH</h3>

<p>This is an improvement upon the two preceding tricks
which I invented several years ago, and have shown
scores of times without the <i>modus operandi</i> being once
detected.</p>

<p><span class="title">Effect.</span>—The pack is handed to the audience to be
shuffled, and, without even glancing at it, the performer
places it behind his back and names each card (presumably
by the sense of touch) before he draws it. He can
hand the pack back to the audience to be shuffled as many
times as desired.</p>

<p><span class="title">Execution.</span>—Before handing the pack to be shuffled,
ascertain which card is on the top, and palm it in the right
<span id="pg_18" class="page_anchor">18 </span>hand; receive the pack back in the palm of the left hand
and cover it with the thumb.</p>

<p>Put both hands behind you and slip the palmed card between
the tips of your left first and second fingers; then
palm the top card and take the card originally palmed
between the right thumb and the forefinger with your
thumb on top. While doing this, explain to the audience
that you have with considerable practice acquired a marvellously
keen sense of touch which enables you to ascertain
the name of each card by simply feeling it. You proceed
to say: “I will name each card before showing it to you,
and you are at liberty to shuffle the pack as many times as
you may desire.</p>

<p>“The card I am now feeling appears to be (say) the
queen of spades.” You then show the card held between
your thumb and finger, at the same time glancing at the
palmed card. Throw the former on the table, and putting
your hand behind your back again, nip the palmed card
with the first two fingers of the left hand, and palm the top
card as before. You can go through the whole pack in
this manner, but each time you hand it to be shuffled, be sure
to have one card palmed. This trick should not be
attempted until it has been thoroughly rehearsed.</p>

<h3 id="where_is_the_ace">WHERE IS THE ACE?</h3>

<p>Select the ace and five of hearts and two other cards of
the same suit and conceal the five behind one of the latter
so as to make it appear you have only three cards. Hold
the two cards (with the concealed five) faces down, a little
distance apart and showing the ace place it deliberately
<span id="pg_19" class="page_anchor">19 </span>behind them so that the pip shows between (<a href="#fig_2">Fig. 2</a>) when
the cards are held up. Having shown the cards in the
latter position to the company, lower them again and defy
any one to lift up the ace. A member of the company
does so and naturally looks at the card, when you say,
“But you must not look at it. Take the card off and
place it face down on the table, and I will then tell you
whether your attempt has been successful. We will try
again?” Re-arranging the cards, substitute the five for the
ace and place it so that the centre pip alone is visible
between the two cards. Repeat your challenge and request
your friend to remove the ace, place it on the table,
and cover it with his hand. When this is done ask him if he
still has the ace, and he will naturally say “Yes.” Tell
him to raise his hand, and to his astonishment he will find
the five.</p>

<h3 id="to_make_a_person_name_a_card_which_you_have_yourself_selected">TO MAKE A PERSON NAME A CARD
WHICH YOU HAVE YOURSELF
SELECTED</h3>

<p>Take any card from two to ten, say the five of hearts, and
lay it face down on the table without permitting any one
<span id="pg_20" class="page_anchor">20 </span>to see its face. Then announce your intention of examining
a number of the company as to their knowledge about
cards. Ask for a volunteer, and on one consenting to act
tell him to answer your questions rapidly and to make his
replies short. Then put the following questions: “How
many cards are there in a full pack?” Answer, “Fifty-two.”
“How many suits?” “Four.” “What are their colours?”
“Red and Black.” “Now name one of those colours.”
“Red.” If he should say “black,” you must say, “You
select black so I take red. How many suits are there
in red?” “Two.” “What are they?” “Hearts and
Diamonds.” “Name one of those suits quickly.” “Hearts.”
If he should name diamonds say, “Then I take hearts.”
“How many cards in the suit?” “Thirteen.” “How
many between the ace and knave?” “Nine.” “How
many below six and how many above six?” “Four below
and four above.” “Name either below or above?”
“Below.” If he says “above,” say, “That gives me those
below six. What are the numbers below six?” “Two,
three, four, and five.” “Name two of those numbers.”
“Four and five.” If he should say “two and three,” or
“three and four” you remark, “That leaves me four and
five. Name one of those numbers.” If he says “four,”
you say, “Which leaves five.<del>”</del> The suit you selected was
hearts, and now we have come down to five. So you have
actually selected the five of hearts; and I am sure you will
admit I have not influenced your choice in any way.
Please turn over the card on the table.” He does so and, of
course, finds it is the five of hearts.</p>

<span id="pg_21" class="page_anchor">21 </span>

<h3 id="the_clock">THE CLOCK</h3>

<p>Select twelve cards of any suit, ace to ten and king and
queen; arrange them in a circle to represent the figures on the
face of a clock, the king as twelve and the queen as eleven
(<a href="#fig_3">Fig. 3</a>), and request a member of the company to think of
one of the numbers. You then explain you will tap the
cards with a pencil and he is to mentally add your first tap
to the number he thought of and count your succeeding
taps until twenty is reached, when he is to call “Stop,” and
your pencil will then rest upon his number. For instance,
we will suppose he thinks of twelve; he must count your
first tap as thirteen and continue counting mentally until
twenty is reached.</p>

<div class="illustration" id="fig_3">
<a href="images/fig_3.png"><img src="images/fig_3_small.png" alt="" width=358 height=358></a>
<p>Fig. 3.</p>
</div>

<span id="pg_22" class="page_anchor">22 </span>

<p><span class="title">Explanation.</span>—Touch the cards at random during the
first seven taps and allow your pencil, on its eighth tap, to
rest on the king (twelve). Eight and twelve being twenty
he will of course say “Stop.” Supposing he thought of a
lower figure—seven, for instance. Tap at random as before
until your eighth tap, which must always be on twelve; then
touch the cards in rotation, making the queen your ninth
tap, the ten your tenth tap, nine your eleventh, and so on
until you reach seven, which will be your thirteenth tap,
which number added to seven, the number thought of, will
make twenty, and your friend will say “Stop.”</p>

<p>Another effective trick can be worked with the card dial,
but it requires the assistance of a confederate. Having
previously instructed him what to do, you tell the company
that <ins title="Note: “anyone” in the original">any one</ins> is at liberty to touch one of the cards during
your absence from the room, and on returning you will
indicate the card he has touched. Upon your returning
hand a pencil to your confederate and request him to touch
the cards in rotation until you say “Stop,” when the pencil
will rest on the right card. Your confederate must hold
the pencil in his right hand with his forefinger resting on
top. When he touches the right card he must raise that
finger slightly. It is a signal no one would notice, and the
trick always creates a great deal of wonder.</p>

<h3 id="how_to_guess_cards_thought_of">HOW TO GUESS CARDS THOUGHT OF</h3>

<p>Allow the pack to be shuffled freely and then place it on
the table face down. Take the three top cards, and holding
them up with their backs towards you, ask some one to
<span id="pg_23" class="page_anchor">23 </span>think of one. Then spread them face down on the table
in front of you. Take three more cards, and ask a second
person to think of one, and lay these on top of the
other three. Show three more cards to a third person, and
after he has thought of one, lay these on top of the
others. You have now three parcels on the table, each
containing three cards. Hold up one parcel, and say to
each person: “Is the card you thought of in this lot?”
Proceed in the same way with the other parcels, and then
tell each person the name of the card he thought of. As
the cards shown to the first person were laid on the table
first, it stands to reason that the cards he thought of must
be at the bottom of the parcel he has said “Yes” to; the
second person’s card will be the middle one in the parcel,
and the third person’s the top card.</p>

<h3 id="an_ingenious_card_trick">AN INGENIOUS CARD TRICK</h3>

<p>Select ten cards, regardless of suit, the ace, and from
deuce to ten, arranging them as follows: Lay the ten face
down on the palm of your hand, the nine next, and the
others in rotation, finishing with the ace, which you call
“one.” Give the cards so arranged to a friend, and tell
him you will leave the room while he moves cards one at a
time, not to exceed nine, from top to bottom, and when
you return you will tell him how many he has shifted.
You may repeat this feat successfully several times, and
finish by requesting him to make up his mind how many
cards he intends moving before you leave the room and
you will tell him which card will indicate the number he
<span id="pg_24" class="page_anchor">24 </span>has selected. On returning you immediately refer him to
the card which gives the correct answer. This is really
a most puzzling trick and yet an easy one to perform.
Commence by showing how the cards are to be moved
by shifting a few yourself, noting how many you move,
so you will remember which card you leave at the bottom.
When you return to the room you subtract the number of
pips on that card from ten and the product will show
the number of the card from the top, the pips on which
indicate the number of cards your friend has moved. We
will suppose that, in illustrating, you move four cards, which
will, of course, leave the four at the bottom; you subtract
four from ten, which leaves six, and no matter how many
cards have been moved the pips on the sixth from the top
will indicate the number. Taking the pack in your hand
face downward, count off the first six cards, and glancing
at the sixth say, “You moved —— cards.<ins title="Note: absent in the original">”</ins> When you
repeat the trick add the number originally at the bottom to
the number your friend has moved, which will give the
number now at the bottom, which you again subtract from
ten. In predicting the number of cards your friend means
to move you tell him the number of the card from the top
which will show it. We will suppose the bottom card is
eight and your friend mentally decides upon moving five
cards, you subtract eight from ten, which leaves two, and
tell him the number he is going to move will be indicated
by the pips on the second card from the top after he has
moved the cards.</p>

<h3 id="to_name_a_card_which_some_one_has_thought_of">TO NAME A CARD WHICH SOME ONE
HAS THOUGHT OF</h3>

<p>Spread six cards before a member of the company and
ask him to think of one. Place these cards at the bottom
of the pack and give the latter a “false shuffle,” i.e. shuffle
them in such a manner that the bottom cards are not disturbed.
Then take the four top cards, and spreading them on
the table, faces upward, ask your friend if his card is among
them. Of course, he will say “No.” While he is looking
at the cards on the table “slip” (<i>Hercat’s Card Tricks</i>,
p. 10) one of the bottom cards to the top of the pack. To
do this moisten the tips of the two middle fingers of the
left hand, and holding the pack in that hand with the
moistened fingers against the face of the bottom card, with
the thumb and two middle fingers of the right hand raise
the rest of the cards slightly and the card adhering to the
moistened fingers will be carried to the top of the pack.
Again spread the four top cards on the table and repeat
the enquiry. If he says “No,” repeat the former process
until he says, “Yes, my card is in that lot.” You, of
course, know it is the card you “slipped” from the bottom
of the pack. You then tell him to gather up all the cards
and shuffle them thoroughly; then place the pack on the
table, put his hand over it and look you steadily in the
eye. You place your hand over his and say, “I can read
your thoughts, you took the ——,” naming his card. This
is an easy trick to perform and causes great amazement.</p>

<p>Select a king and the four knaves and lay the king
on the table face upward. Tell the company that the
king is recruiting for the army and accepts the knave of
clubs, which you place on the king’s right. The knave of
spades, which you place on the left, he rejects. The knave
of diamonds is accepted and placed on the right. The
knave of hearts is declined, and placed on the left.</p>

<p>Now ask your audience how it is that the king, being in
want of recruits, accepts two and refuses two.</p>

<p>The answer will puzzle those not acquainted with the

eye each, and are consequently medically unfit.</p>

face down on the four. Then remove the three top
<span id="pg_27" class="page_anchor">27 </span>cards, without in any way altering their order, and place
them on the face of the pack so that the two spot is showing,
and turn the five spot face down, so that the pack
appears to be without preparation.</p>

<p><span class="title">Presentation.</span>—Show pack held in left hand and call
special attention to the two spot on the bottom of the
pack, then lift off the five-spot card and pass it to a
spectator with the remark that the centre spot is loose and
can be transferred at will to any other card; while the
card is being examined you secretly count off the three
other prepared cards at the bottom of the pack and keep
them separated from the rest with the index finger of left
hand. Now take back the five-spot card and place it on
the back of the pack, with its face side toward audience.
Then with the first two fingers and thumb of right
hand take the three other cards from bottom of pack
and show them as one card only: namely, the two spot.
This movement is best executed by slightly pushing down
the three cards with the index finger of left hand until a
sufficient amount of projection is obtained for the fingers
and thumb of right hand to grip. Now place the apparent
two-spot card face toward, and on to the five spot; proceed
by gently rubbing the back card with the index finger
of right hand, and lift the top card and show it to be a
three spot, while the card facing is found to be a four spot,
which you also remove. The back of the two-spot card
will then be seen and the pack appear to be an unprepared
one.</p>

<h3 id="an_artful_card_force">AN ARTFUL CARD FORCE</h3>

<p><span class="title">Presentation.</span>—First secretly note what the top card of
the pack is. Then proceed by asking a spectator to state
what card he wishes you to use by giving you a number.
After having received the number you proceed to count the
cards face down on to a table until you reach that number,
at the same time mentioning that the last card counted is
the one you are to use. You pause for a moment, apparently
thinking, then say, it is possible that the spectator
may think that you already know the card as you counted
them yourself, you consider that it would only be fair to
allow him to count them himself. At the same time you
replace the counted cards, and hand the pack to spectator,
with the request that he counts down to the number
previously stated. This, of course, has the effect of
bringing the known top card into position at his number,
so that it is quite an easy matter to follow on with any
trick in which the sleight-of-hand force is necessary. This
seems very simple, but try the effect; even our advanced
friends will find it extremely useful.</p>

<h3 id="another_easy_card_force">ANOTHER EASY CARD FORCE</h3>

<p><span class="title">Requisites.</span>—An ordinary pack of cards and two extra
cards stuck securely together.</p>

<p>Place the double card below a previously noted card.
Hold the pack in the left hand so that the thumb can pass
readily down the cards at the upper corner. Now pass the
thumb of the right hand down the cards so as to ruffle
them. You will find that the thumb is automatically
<span id="pg_29" class="page_anchor">29 </span>stopped at the double card. By requesting <ins title="Note: absent in the original">a </ins>spectator to
take the card immediately above the break in the pack,
you can then proceed with any trick in which a forced
card is necessary. Numerous other uses for the double
card will readily occur to my readers from the hint given.</p>

<h3 id="a_simple_but_puzzling_card_trick">A SIMPLE BUT PUZZLING CARD TRICK</h3>

<p>Place the pack face down on the table and cover it with
a serviette. Then request a member of the company to
put his hand under the serviette and take a card at random;
to be careful not to let you see it but show it to the company
and then return it to the pack and to square the pack
through the serviette after the card has been replaced.
You then lift up the side of the serviette nearest to
you and at once produce the card.</p>

<p><span class="title">Explanation.</span>—When the company are looking at the
card slip your hand under the serviette and turn the pack
over, and, of course, you can at once detect the “faced”
card when it is replaced. On withdrawing it with your
right hand turn the pack over with your left and lift off
the serviette.</p>

<span id="pg_30" class="page_anchor">30 </span>

<h2 id="simple_coin_tricks">SIMPLE COIN TRICKS</h2>

<h3 id="how_to_detect_a_marked_coin">HOW TO DETECT A MARKED COIN</h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="first_word">Place</span> ten coins—say shillings—in any empty finger-bowl
and request a member of the company to select one, put
a private mark on it, and then holding it in his closed hand,
to close his eyes and think of the appearance of the coin
very hard. In about a minute pick up the<del> the</del> bowl, and
going to him, request him to open his eyes; gaze in them,
and then make a few mesmeric passes over his face. Then
request him to drop the coin he holds in the bowl and to
mix it up thoroughly with the other nine shillings. Now
ask some one to blindfold you; when this is done place
your hand in the bowl, and picking up the shillings one at
a time, you can at once detect his, which you throw across
the table to him for confirmation. The secret is that the
coin held in the person’s hand has obtained a certain
degree of warmth and can at once be detected in consequence.</p>

<h3 id="a_penetrative_shilling">A PENETRATIVE SHILLING</h3>

<p>Sew a halfpenny in the corner of your handkerchief and
place the latter in your pocket ready for the trick. Borrow
a shilling and request the lender to put a private mark on
<span id="pg_31" class="page_anchor">31 </span>it. Take out your handkerchief and pretend to place the
shilling under it, instead of which pick up the corner containing
the halfpenny, place it in the centre and grasp it
through the handkerchief with your left hand, while you let
the marked shilling drop in the palm of your right. Ask
a member of the company to hold the shilling (the halfpenny
in the centre) in the handkerchief a few inches
above the table. Then pick up an empty glass with your
right hand, hold it under the table, and request the person
who holds the handkerchief to let it fall on the table. The
coin in the handkerchief will be heard to strike the latter
and at the same time you drop the shilling from the palm
of your right hand into the glass and place the latter on the
table, while with your left hand you pick up the handkerchief
and shake it, being careful not to allow the halfpenny
to strike the table again while you are doing so.
Request the person who lent the shilling to take it out of
the glass and say if it is the one bearing his private mark.</p>

<h3 id="another_simple_trick">ANOTHER SIMPLE TRICK</h3>

<p>Here is another simple trick with a sixpence. Put
a small piece of wax on it, and place it, the waxed side
uppermost, in the centre of a handkerchief. Then put
one of the lower corners of the handkerchief over the coin
and ask some one to put his finger on it and press it. Then
move the second lower corner of the handkerchief over the
other corner, telling your assistant to move his finger while
you do so. Next cover the two lower corners with the
two upper corners of the handkerchief in the same manner,
and ask your assistant if he is sure the sixpence is still
<span id="pg_32" class="page_anchor">32 </span>there. Of course he will say yes; he can feel it. Then
tell him to raise his finger. When he does so, take the two
upper corners in your hands, and raise the handkerchief,
when the coin will appear to have vanished. Of course, it
is sticking to the lower corner of the handkerchief.</p>

<h3 id="a_coin_to_disappear_from_your_cheek_and_reappear_at_your_elbow">A COIN TO DISAPPEAR FROM YOUR
CHEEK AND REAPPEAR AT YOUR
ELBOW</h3>

<p>While sitting at the table turn up your right sleeve, and,
taking a half-crown or penny, rub it against your cheek, and
then, as if by accident, drop it on the table. Pick up the
coin and repeat the process, this time resting your elbow
on the table, as you explain, to steady it. Move your
hand from your cheek, and the coin has disappeared, and
with your left hand produce it from your elbow. Then
say, “I will reverse the experiment and send the coin back.”
Place your empty hand against your face and your left
hand containing the coin under your elbow. After rubbing
your face and chin, show the coin again in your right hand
and your left hand empty. You require two coins for this
trick, one palmed in your left hand. When you rub the
coin against your face the second time, drop it inside
your collar and produce the palmed coin from your elbow.
When you “reverse the experiment,” take the coin from your
collar as you are rubbing your face and chin and drop the
other coin from your left hand into your handkerchief
spread over your knees.</p>

<span id="pg_33" class="page_anchor">33 </span>

<h3 id="two_vanished_half-crowns">TWO VANISHED HALF-CROWNS</h3>

<p>This trick requires considerable practice, but is a very
effective one. Take the two coins in your right hand, and
throw them repeatedly, one at a time, into the other hand
until the audience begin to think it is a “sell.” Then, offering
your left hand (in which the coins are supposed to be) to
some one, say: “Well, you try to do it.” Open your hand,
and the coins have disappeared.</p>

<p><span class="title">Explanation.</span>—The last time you throw only one half-crown,
and instead of throwing the second, bring the right
hand down quickly, and at the same time jerk the coin in
your left hand upwards into your right, and it will strike
the coin retained there. The clink will be heard, and by
closing your left hand quickly you will lead the company
to suppose both coins are in that hand. Half-crowns are
the best coins for the trick owing to their weight.</p>

<h3 id="a_divination">A DIVINATION</h3>

<p>Request a member of the company (seated) to place a
shilling or florin upon each knee, and cover them with his
hands with his fingers stretched out. You then tell him,
when you turn your back, to raise one of the coins and tap
his head with it twelve times just above his ear; then replace
it on his knee and cover it with his hands as before; and
you will tell him, on examining the coins, which one he
raised.</p>

<p>The examination of the coins has really nothing to do
with the trick. All you have to do is to look at the person’s
hands; the blood leaves the hand that has been raised, and
<span id="pg_34" class="page_anchor">34 </span>when it is again placed beside the other the difference in
colour is most perceptible.</p>

<p>I have performed this trick hundreds of times in drawing-rooms,
and it has never been detected, but created great
surprise.</p>

<h3 id="an_effective_but_simple_trick">AN EFFECTIVE BUT SIMPLE TRICK</h3>

<p>Stick a halfpenny (or a shilling) under the edge of a
table secretly with a small piece of wax. Show another
halfpenny to the company, and when it is returned to you,
place it in front of you on the table while you turn up
your sleeves. Then place the fingers of your left hand
under the table, and with your right hand sweep the halfpenny
on the table into your left, at the same time getting
hold of the halfpenny under the table, taking care that one
coin does not strike the other. Then place your right
hand over your left, and pretend to rub the halfpenny the
audience have examined very vigorously, and, showing both
coins, say you have rubbed one halfpenny into two. You
can improve on this trick by using four halfpence on the
table and one stuck under the edge. Sweep two coins into
your left hand, get possession of the stuck halfpenny, and
close your hand. Hold it up, and say: “There are two
halfpennies on the table, and I have two in this hand.”
Picking up the two halfpennies with your right hand, tell
the company that you intend to pass one of them into the
other hand. Then lay both hands flat on the table, lift
your left hand, and show three halfpennies under it. Slide
your right hand off the table, leaving one halfpenny behind,
and carrying the second coin away with your fingers. As
<span id="pg_35" class="page_anchor">35 </span>your hand leaves the table, press the halfpenny with your
thumb against your two middle fingers, and nip it with your
first and little fingers. Remove your thumb, and you will
find you can hold it securely “palmed.” Then with the
right hand sweep the three halfpennies back into the left
hand, at the same time letting the “palmed” coin fall with
them. Close your fingers over them quickly, and picking
up the remaining halfpenny from the table with your right
hand, say: “I intend to make this halfpenny join its companions.
One, two, three—go!”</p>

<p>Pushing it with your thumb against your two middle
fingers, palm it as before, and throw the four coins which
you hold in your left hand on the table. While the attention
of the company is on them, drop the “palmed” coin
in your pocket.</p>

<h3 id="changing_apple_and_coins">CHANGING APPLE AND COINS</h3>

<p>Procure two small apples exactly alike, and in the bottom
of one scoop out a hole large enough to hold a pile of three
sixpences. Make a conical cover out of cartridge paper
large enough to cover the apple and about nine inches in
height. Obtain six sixpences, three of which place in a
pile on an inverted glass goblet. Conceal the other three
and the hollow apple in your left hand. Ask <ins title="Note: “someone” in the original">some one</ins>
to examine the cover, and, on receiving it back, transfer it
to your left hand and slip it over the apple. Then give the
duplicate apple for examination, and, taking the cover by
its lower part, and the apple concealed in it, place both
over the three sixpences on the glass. Take the apple that
has been examined, and put it under the table with your
left hand, hold it between your knees, and say: “I command
<span id="pg_36" class="page_anchor">36 </span>this apple to pass through the table and take the
place now occupied by the three sixpences, and the sixpences
to fall into my hand.” Bring your left hand from
under the table and show the coins, lift up the cover and
show the apple on the glass. Then reverse the procedure.
Cover the apple on the glass; place the three sixpences
under the table; secure the apple held between your knees
and roll it on the table; lift up the cover and hollow apple
together, and, dropping the latter into your lap, show the
former is empty. This trick should be performed sitting.</p>

<h3 id="an_obedient_sixpence">AN OBEDIENT SIXPENCE</h3>

<p>Place two half-crowns (or pennies) on the table and a sixpence
between them. Then cover the coins with an inverted
wine-glass, the edges of the latter resting upon the larger
coins. Challenge any one to remove the sixpence without
touching the glass or the money. It is done very easily,
and in an amusing manner. You have only to scratch the
tablecloth with your finger-nail in the direction you wish
the coin to come, saying: “Come hither, sixpence,” and it
will at once obey you.</p>

<h3 id="coin_and_glass">COIN AND GLASS</h3>

<p>Cover the mouths of two glasses with newspaper, by
gumming it on them, and trim off the edges neatly.<a class="footnote" href="#fn_1" id="fnc_1">[A]</a> Stand
them inverted upon two pieces of newspaper in such a
manner that the type on the paper over the glasses fairly
corresponds with that on the paper on the table. Make
two cones of newspaper to fit closely over each glass.
Unobserved by the company, place a penny under the glass
<span id="pg_37" class="page_anchor">37 </span>on your left, which will of course be concealed by the paper
on the mouth of the glass. Then borrow a penny, and,
placing the cone over the glass on your right, lift the latter
covered by the former from the table; lay the borrowed
penny on the newspaper, and cover with the glass and
cone. You call attention to the fact that there is nothing
under the other glass, and you then cover it with the
second cone. You now tell the company that at your word
of command the penny will leave one glass and travel invisibly
over the table to the other glass. You lift the cone
from the glass on your right, under which the borrowed
penny was placed, and the coin is not to be seen. Then,
lifting both the cone and glass together on your left, the
concealed penny is brought into view. You now announce
your intention of sending the penny back. Place the
covered glass over the penny and replace the cover over
the glass on your right. “One, two, three—go!” you
exclaim and, lifting the cone off the glass on your left,
the penny under it appears to have disappeared, and on
removing the other glass, still covered by the cone, the
borrowed penny will once more be seen. This trick can
be worked with one glass only and the penny made to
appear to drop through the table in your hand placed
under the latter ready to catch it (the penny, of course,
being already palmed in your hand); but the use of two
glasses makes the trick more effective, and it can be
repeated many times without fear of detection. The paper
upon which the glasses stand can, of course, be examined;
but the glasses when removed from the paper must be
covered with the cones, or the paper cover on the mouth of
each will be seen.</p>

<h3 id="a_simple_experiment_with_four_shillings">A SIMPLE EXPERIMENT WITH FOUR
SHILLINGS</h3>

<p>Borrow four shillings; place one on the palm of each
hand, and, holding the palms upward, close your fingers
over them. Then request a member of the company to
place the other two coins on the nails of your two middle
fingers; and announce your intention of throwing a
coin from one hand to the other, explaining it is rather
a difficult feat to accomplish with your hands closed.
Make one or two movements with your hands, and then, as
if accidentally, drop the two shillings resting upon your
nails upon the table. Apologising for your clumsiness,
request some one to replace the coins on your
nails, saying you will have another try. Now give your
hands a jerk upward; open them and catch the coins on
your nails, one in each hand, and tell the company you
have accomplished your purpose and sent one coin flying
invisibly through the air from one hand to the other. To
verify your assertion open your hands and show three coins
in one hand and only one in the other.</p>

<div class="center">
<span class="title">Explanation.</span>
</div>

<p>When you make the first attempt, and appear to fail, in the
upward movement of your hands you open them and allow
the shilling resting upon the nail of your left hand to slip
into the palm, while you permit the coin in the palm of
your right hand to fall, with the one above it on the nail,
on the table. If this is done neatly the company will
suppose it is the two coins from the nails which have fallen.
You now have two shillings in your left hand and none
<span id="pg_39" class="page_anchor">39 </span>in your right. In the second attempt you have only to
catch the shillings resting on your nails in the manner
described, and on showing one shilling in your right hand
and three in your left, your statement that one has travelled
invisibly from one hand to the other will appear to be
correct.</p>

<h3 id="puzzle_of_ten_halfpence">PUZZLE OF TEN HALFPENCE</h3>

<p>Place ten halfpence in a row upon the table, then taking
up any one of the series, place it upon another, with this
proviso, that you pass over just two halfpence each time.
Repeat this until there is not a single halfpenny left. Let
the following figures represent the halfpence:—</p>

<div class="center">
<span class="large">1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10</span>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Place No. 4 upon No. 1; No. 7 upon No. 3; No. 5 upon
No. 9; No. 2 upon No. 6; and No. 8 upon No. 10. A little
practice will enable the reader to do this puzzle without
referring to the figures.</p>

<h3 id="how_to_increase_your_wealth">HOW TO INCREASE YOUR WEALTH</h3>

<p>Obtain three sixpences exactly alike, place one in your
pocket and stick the other two with a small piece of wax
under the edge of the table about an inch apart. After
showing other tricks produce the sixpence from your pocket
and show it to the company to prove it is an ordinary coin.
Pull up your sleeves, and if the table has a cover turn it
back. Place the coin on the table near the edge over the
concealed sixpences, and showing your right hand is perfectly
empty place your thumb over the coin and rub it
<span id="pg_40" class="page_anchor">40 </span>vigorously backwards and forwards on the table. At the
same time run your first and second fingers under the table,
and securing one of the coins sticking there move it and the
coin under your thumb simultaneously off the table, and
pinching them together between your thumb and finger,
say: “I will show you how to double your capital. I am
going to rub this sixpence into two sixpences.” Then
showing your other hand is empty use the left thumb and
finger to assist in the rubbing, and gradually separate the two
coins and exhibit them. Then putting the sixpence with
the wax in your pocket place the other one near the edge
of the table and repeat the trick, saying: “See, I have now
trebled my capital.” Do not allow the company to examine
the waxed coins.</p>

<h3 id="a_neat_coin_trick">A NEAT COIN TRICK</h3>

<p>Procure three coins (pennies or half-crowns) exactly alike.
Scratch a cross on two, and in the third bore a hole, in
which fasten a short piece of black elastic cord. The
other end of the elastic tie round your ankle, taking care
that the coin does not hang below your trouser leg. Put
one of the marked pennies in your left-hand trousers
pocket and drop the other one unobserved into the pocket
of some one present, or give it to a confederate to hold.
Commence by borrowing a similar coin to those you are
using and mark it like the others. Hold it between
the thumb and finger of the right hand, and, giving it a
twist, spin it on the table, then snapping your fingers over
it, catch the edge of the coin and it will fly up your sleeve.
Close your hand and say, “I will make this coin fly up my
<span id="pg_41" class="page_anchor">41 </span>sleeve, travel round my back, and pass down my other
sleeve.” In the meantime you have secured the penny in
your pocket and concealed it in your left hand. Open your
right hand, showing it is empty, and then show the penny
in the other hand. Lower your right hand, the penny in
your sleeve will drop into it, and you can pocket it unobserved.
Then ask for the loan of a cap and walking-stick.
Request some one to hold the stick, while you hold
the cap in your left hand. Pick up the penny with your
right hand and pretend to place it on the floor. In doing
so substitute the coin attached to the elastic, and, stretching
the latter, hold the coin on the floor while you cover it
with the cap, and ask the person who has the stick to place
its end on the coin through the cap and keep it there until
you tell him to move it. Then say, “I command this coin
to leave the cap and pass into Mr. So-and-So’s pocket.
Move the stick, please, and then lift up the cap.” On the
removal of the stick the coin will fly under your trouser
leg, and, of course, when the cap is lifted it is no longer
on the floor. On the person whose name you mentioned
putting his hand in his pocket he will find the coin you
placed there, which you return to the person from whom
you borrowed the penny.</p>

<h3 id="a_subtle_impromptu_effect_with_a_coin">A SUBTLE IMPROMPTU EFFECT WITH
A COIN</h3>

<p><span class="title">Effect.</span>—A coin dropped down the sleeve is slowly
rubbed out through the cloth at the elbow.</p>

<p><span class="title">Requisites.</span>—Two coins exactly alike.</p>

<p><span class="title">Presentation.</span>—First secretly place one of the coins
<span id="pg_42" class="page_anchor">42 </span>between the buttons at the end of your left coat sleeve.
Then stand with your right side towards spectators with
the left arm extended, but slightly bent at the elbow.
After having the coin examined, proceed to drop it down
the sleeve of the extended arm, when it will fall to the
elbow, and ask a spectator to feel that it is really there.
Proceed by placing thumb of right hand on the side of
sleeve toward spectators, and the fingers at the back, and
rub the hand up and down the sleeve from the elbow to
the cuff, and at the same time secretly gain possession of
the coin between the buttons and bring it down behind the
sleeve towards the elbow. Now with a slow pinching
movement bring the coin down between the thumb and
fingers and apparently out through the cloth of the sleeve,
meanwhile moving the left arm up and down slightly.
The coin left in the sleeve can be secretly got away by
dropping the arm and allowing it to fall into the hand
and then pocketed.</p>

<h3 id="an_original_coin_swindle">AN ORIGINAL COIN SWINDLE</h3>

<p>Palm a halfpenny in your right hand and ask a friend
(be sure he <i>is</i> your friend) to lend you a shilling. Pick up
a glass, invert it, and place the borrowed shilling on its
bottom. Then ask your friend whether the coin is on the
top or bottom of the tumbler. He will naturally look surprised
at such a question; and you then say,—“Ah, I see
you know the trick.” Slide the shilling off the glass into
your right hand, and as your friend holds out his hand to
receive it back, drop the concealed halfpenny into it. The
chances are ten to one that he will place the coin in his
<span id="pg_43" class="page_anchor">43 </span>pocket without glancing at it. Unless you really desire to
swindle your friend out of elevenpence halfpenny you will,
of course, explain to him how he has been “had.”</p>

<h3 id="a_cross">A CROSS</h3>

<p>Place seven coins on the table, five in a row and one

two only, all the arms of the cross to have the same number
of coins. After many attempts and failures show how
easy it is to accomplish by taking the two coins at the ends
of the row and placing them upon the coin in the centre.</p>

<h3 id="half_a_burnt_message_found_restored_in_a_candle">HALF A BURNT MESSAGE FOUND
RESTORED IN A CANDLE</h3>

<p>Procure two candles and from one cut one-third off, in
which piece drill a hole lengthwise and remove the wick.
Put this piece in your pocket and place the other candle in
a candlestick. Give a small piece of paper to a member
of the company and request him to write a short sentence on
it. Tear the paper in two, and giving him half, retain
the other half yourself, which you fold up. Have a similar
piece of paper, folded, concealed in your right hand, and as
you turn to get the candle (which should be lighted), substitute
one for the other. Burn the plain piece of paper in
the candle, and obtaining the piece of candle from your
pocket put your hands behind your back, and, having rolled
up the half message, work it into the hole in the piece of
candle. In order to gain the time to do this stoop over the
lighted candle and make several unsuccessful attempts to
blow it out. When the paper is in the piece of candle give one
good hard blow and extinguish the light. With the piece
of candle concealed in your left hand, take the candle out
of the candlestick, lay it on the table, and with a knife cut
off the burnt end, which throw away and divide the remainder
into three equal parts. Then ask the person who
wrote the message to select one piece. When he does so
pick up the selected piece with your right hand and pretend
to transfer it to your left, but retain it in the right and show
the piece concealed in your left, which you present to the
<span id="pg_47" class="page_anchor">47 </span>person who wrote the sentence and request him to pull out
the piece of paper, which he will find to be the corresponding
half of the piece in his possession.</p>

<h3 id="two_good_ring_tricks">TWO GOOD RING TRICKS</h3>

<p>Take a common ring, about the size of a wedding-ring,
and suspend it to the centre of your handkerchief by
a piece of cotton four inches long. You can hold the
handkerchief up by the corners with the ring hanging in
front of you, and the latter will not be noticed. Then let
the handkerchief fall over your left hand and the ring in
your palm. Request the loan of a wedding-ring, and,
having obtained one, put it under the handkerchief, drop
it in your palm, and pick up the other ring, which push up
in the centre of the handkerchief, requesting some one to
hold it there. Next take a drinking-glass in your right
hand and request the person to drop the ring in it and the
handkerchief over it. Shake the glass, and the ring will
be heard to rattle inside. Then stand the glass in the
palm of your left hand with its bottom over the borrowed
ring, which is concealed there. With your right hand
pinch the centre of the handkerchief and lift it up quickly,
of course, carrying the suspended ring with it, being very
careful not to let the ring strike the glass. The glass is
seen to be empty; lift it up and show the ring underneath.
Say, “You see, the ring has passed through the bottom of
the tumbler.”</p>

<p>A similar and a better trick can be performed with
a short cane—say about eighteen inches long—instead of
a glass. Commence as in the previous trick, and after you
<span id="pg_48" class="page_anchor">48 </span>have asked some one to hold the suspended ring through
the handkerchief, show the cane, and, holding your left
hand back upward, push it through the latter and the
borrowed ring, and grasp the cane with, of course, the ring
on it, in the centre. With your right hand take the ring
and handkerchief from the person who holds them, and
request him to take hold of each end of the cane. Now
lower the handkerchief until it hides your left hand, when
you must move the latter away, leaving the ring on the
cane concealed by the handkerchief. Then let the suspended
ring fall out of the handkerchief, and if it strikes
the cane so much the better. Whip the handkerchief
away, and the ring on the cane will be seen. How that
ring could have got on the cane while the ends of the
latter were being held will puzzle everybody. Pocket the
handkerchief with the suspended ring at once, and don’t
allow it to be examined.</p>

<h3 id="to_ascertain_a_number_thought_of">TO ASCERTAIN A NUMBER THOUGHT OF</h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="first_word">Every</span> schoolboy knows the old puzzle: Think of a
number; double it; add 10, <ins title="Note: “multiply” in the original">divide</ins> by 2, subtract
number thought of; and 5 left. Here is a great improvement
upon that problem, which I have seen puzzle some
excellent accountants.</p>

<p>Think of a number; multiply by 3; if the result is
odd, add 1 and divide by 2; multiply by 3; if result
be odd, add 1, and again divide by 2. By how many 9’s
is the result divisible?</p>

<p>On receipt of that information you at once give the
number thought of. One of the most puzzling features of
the trick is that no 9’s are obtainable in the result should
either 1, 2, or 3 be thought of, as the following will show:—</p>

<p>As will be seen, none of these results is divisible by 9,
yet the number thought of is correctly given in each
instance.</p>

<p><span class="title">Solution.</span>—When the number thought of is multiplied by
3, you ask the question, “Is the result odd or even?” If
the answer is “odd,” make a mental note of <i>one</i>; then
proceed. “Add one and divide by two. Is the result odd
or even?” If the answer is again “odd,” make a mental
note of <i>two</i>; and proceed. “Add one and divide by two.
How many nines are obtainable in the result? I do not
want to know what the surplus is.”</p>

<p>The above figures illustrate that when 1 is the number
thought of there is only an addition of 1. When 2 is
the figure, no addition is required to the first result; but
the second result being 9, 1 is added and <i>two</i> noted,
which, of course, is the figure thought of. When 3 is
thought of two additions are necessary, one to the 9
and one to the 15, making a total of <i>three</i> to be remembered,
which represents the original number. When
4 or any succeeding number is thought of the final result
is always divisible by 9, and in your mental calculation
each 9 must represent 4, to which you add the figures you
have previously noted.</p>

<div class="center">
<span class="title">Examples.</span>
</div>

<p>Number thought of 4 × 3 = 12 ÷ 2 = 6 × 3 = 18 ÷ 2 = 9.</p>

<p>Here we have one 9, which represents 4, the number
thought of.</p>

<p>Number thought of 7 × 3 = 21 + 1 = 22 ÷ 2 = 11 × 3 = 33
+ 1 = 34 ÷ 2 = 17. From which is obtainable only one 9,
which represents 4, to which you add 1 for the first addition

the number thought of.</p>

<h3 id="how_to_name_a_number_which_has_been_erased">HOW TO NAME A NUMBER WHICH
HAS BEEN ERASED</h3>

<p>Request a member of the company to write a row of
figures, the number of which is immaterial, add them
together and subtract the addition from the row. Then to
cross out any figure from the result, add the remaining
figures together and give you the total, when you will tell
him which figure he has erased. Of course, you do not
see his figures and can leave the room while he makes
them.</p>

<p class="noindent">We will suppose he crosses out 7, which makes the addition
of the row, minus that figure, 29. He gives you that result
and you at once name the crossed off figure. There are
two ways of arriving at the answer. The simplest and
quickest way is to add the units in the result together until
only one figure remains and deduct it from 9. For
instance, we will take 29. Add the 2 and 9 together,
which make 11; add 1 and 1 together and you have 2,
which deduct from 9, leaving 7, the figure erased in the
above example.</p>

<p>Supposing 1 was the figure erased, the addition of the
remaining figures would then be 35; 3 + 5 = 8<ins title="Note: “.” in the original">,</ins> 9 - 8 = 1,
the figure crossed off.</p>

<p>The second method is to reckon the next multiple of
9 above the figures given you; for instance, supposing
they are 29, the next multiple of 9 is 36. Deduct 29 from
it and it leaves 7, the erased figure. If either 9 or 0 is
erased the result is the same. You can get out of the
difficulty, on being told you are wrong, by saying (in case
you have given 9), “Yes, I see it is a nought; I thought it
had a tail, so mistook it for a nine.” If you have named 0
and it turns out to be 9, you can say, “Oh, I didn’t notice
the tail; of course I should have said nine.”</p>

<p class="noindent">Take the paper from him and, after pretending to scrutinise
the row, ask him to point out which figure he considers
<span id="pg_53" class="page_anchor">53 </span>most imperfectly made. If he should select the 1,
say, “You had better practise making that figure. Oblige
me by multiplying the row by nine.” When he does so the
result will be</p>

<div class="center">
<span class="large">1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1</span>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Then say, “After this practice you will be able to make

<div class="center">
<span class="large">4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4</span>
</div>

<p>Whichever figure he selects, mentally multiply it by 9

all 9’s.</p>

<span id="pg_54" class="page_anchor">54 </span>You mentally subtract the 2 and place it before the 1,
making 21,910, which figures write on a piece of paper,
which you fold up and lay on the table. You then ask
a second person to place four figures under the first line.
Then add a line yourself, which must be a deduction
of the second line from four 9’s. Ask a third person
to add four figures to those already written. Then add
another line yourself, making it a deduction of the third
person’s figures from four 9’s. Request a fourth person
to add up the sum and tell him you have already done so,
and he will find the answer on the table. The sum will
appear something like this:—</p>

deduct the line immediately preceding theirs from 9’s

<p>Girls of a marriageable age do not like to tell how old

instructions, the young lady doing the figuring: Tell her
to put down the number of the month in which she was
<span id="pg_56" class="page_anchor">56 </span>born, then to multiply it by 2, then to add 5, then to
multiply it by 50, then to add her age, then to subtract 365,
then to add 115, then tell her to tell you the amount she
has left. The two figures to the right will tell you her age
and the remainder the month of her birth. For example,
the amount is 822, she is twenty-two years old and was
born in the eighth month (August).</p>

<h3 id="a_race_in_addition">A RACE IN ADDITION</h3>

<p>Tell a friend that you will race him in counting from
1 to 100, and guarantee to win, under the following conditions:
You will allow him to start first, at any number
from 1 to 10, and you are both to have the privilege of
adding any figure up to 10 to the last number called. For
instance, we will suppose he starts with 5. You call 15,
having mentally added 10 to his number. He then calls
20, having added 5; and so on, until 100 is reached.
Until he sees through the trick you will win every time, and
even then you will win if you start first and commence at 1.
In that case, as he can only add 10, his first call could not
exceed 11, to which you immediately add 1 and call 12.
If his next call is 22, you say 23. No matter what his
additions may be, the numbers you must always reach first
are 12, 23, 34, 45, 56, 67, 78, and 89. When you call the
latter number, as he can only add 10 to it, your next call
will, of course, be 100. By this you will observe that,
although you can only add 10 to your opponent’s last
number, you in reality add 11 to your own. So you are,
so to speak, always 1 ahead of him. If, when you suggest
the trick, you see your friend is not familiar with it, you
<span id="pg_57" class="page_anchor">57 </span>can give him the option of starting first, and you need not
pick up the thread of your winning numbers until you
reach 50, adding low numbers to his additions, which will
help to puzzle him; but he will soon see that it is necessary
to reach 89; then he will notice you strike 78 and 67.
When you see he is getting on the right track, pick up the
winning numbers earlier, and at last insist that you must
now start first. In starting with a person who does not
know the trick it is advisable, and more puzzling, to dodge
about at first and not get on the track of the winning
numbers until 56 or 67. But if your friend knows the
trick and starts at 1 you cannot beat him. I have seen
good accountants puzzle for hours over this little trick,
which was invented by Mr. William Lawtey, a dear old
friend of mine.</p>

<h3 id="to_predict_the_hour_your_friend_intends_to_rise_on_the_following_morning">TO PREDICT THE HOUR YOUR FRIEND

MORNING</h3>

<p>Request your friend to make up his mind as to the time
he intends to rise on the following morning, and then to
mention an entirely different hour to you. To the latter
you mentally add twelve, and giving him the number of the
total, request him to look at his watch, and starting at the
hour preceding the one he has selected for rising, to count
backwards until he reaches the number you have given him,
beginning with the number which he previously gave you.
Ask him to state the hour at which he stops, which he will
find is the one he selected for rising. For instance; supposing
your friend intends to rise at nine and gives you
<span id="pg_58" class="page_anchor">58 </span>four. To four you mentally add twelve and request him to
start at the hour before his getting-up time (which would
be eight) and count sixteen backwards on the face of the
watch, starting with the number he gave you—four—and
when he reaches sixteen his finger or pencil will rest upon
nine, the hour he selected for getting up.</p>

<p>Make the figure 9 with a long tail with matches (<a href="#fig_9">Fig. 9</a>)
and tell a member of the company to think of a number,
which must exceed the
number of matches in the

the first match in the latter,
count mentally round the
figure, stop when he reaches
the number thought of, and
then, recommencing at the
match he stopped at, count
the reverse way, this time
avoiding the tail, and continuing
on the upper part
of the 9 until he again
reaches the number he
selected, when you will
point to the match he has stopped at. This you can do
very easily, for if there are seven matches in the tail he will,
of course, stop at the seventh match on the left from the
tail, as will be seen by the numbering on the diagram,
which assumes he thought of fifteen. Each time the
puzzle is tried vary the length of the tail by taking some
matches out of the latter and adding them to the upper
part of the figure, or vice versa. If this is not done the
<span id="pg_61" class="page_anchor">61 </span>stop will always be made at the same match, which will
give the trick away.</p>

<h3 id="triangles_with_matches">TRIANGLES WITH MATCHES</h3>

<p>Make three equilateral triangles with six matches. Of
course, two can be made with five matches; but then there
is one over, and how to make a third triangle with only
one match is a puzzler. It is as easy as possible. Make a
triangle with three matches, and stand the other three
upon end inside the triangle in the form of a tripod
(<a href="#fig_10">Fig. 10</a>).</p>

<p>Here is another triangular puzzle. With five matches
form two equilateral triangles. Tell the company they are
to remove three matches; then add two and make two
more equilateral triangles. This is only a “sell.” You do
not say where the two matches are to be added. You add
them to the three removed, and form the same figure
over again (<a href="#fig_11">Fig. 11</a>).</p>

<h3 id="your_opponent_must_take_the_last_match">YOUR OPPONENT MUST TAKE THE
LAST MATCH</h3>

<p>Place twenty-five matches in a row on the table. Request
some one to select one end of the row and to take
one, two, or three matches from it, you having the same
privilege at the other end; and you guarantee he will be
compelled to take the last match no matter how he may
vary the number he takes.</p>

<p>The secret is to remove four matches each time between
you. For instance, if your opponent takes three you take
one; if he takes two you take two; if he takes one you
take three and so on. It is obvious if four matches are
taken six times one match will be left on the table, which
your opponent must take.</p>

by the addition of three
more matches (<a href="#fig_14">Fig. 14</a>). “But,”
some one will say, “how does
KINI represent a Shakespearean
quotation?” Your reply is obvious:
“Can’t you see KINI is ‘a little more than kin,
but rather less than kind’?”</p>

<h3 id="the_artful_schoolboys">THE ARTFUL SCHOOLBOYS</h3>

<p>At a certain school were four long dormitories, built in
the form of a square, in which thirty-two boys occupied
beds, as shown by matches in <a href="#fig_17">Fig. 17</a>.</p>

<p>Fig. 17.</p>
</div>

<p>By this arrangement the master, in going his rounds at
night, counted twelve boys in each corridor. One night
four boys absented themselves from the school, and the
remaining boys rearranged themselves in such a manner
that the master was still able to count twelve boys in each
corridor, and the absence of their four comrades was not
noticed. How they did it is shown in <a href="#fig_18">Fig. 18</a>.</p>

</div>

<p>The four absentees returned on the following night,
accompanied by four friends; but the master was unable
to notice the addition, for he again counted twelve boys
in each dormitory. The new arrangement was as <a href="#fig_19">Fig. 19</a>.</p>

<p>There were now thirty-six boys sleeping in the dormitories,
and next night they were joined by four more,
which brought the number up to forty, and yet the master
<span id="pg_65" class="page_anchor">65 </span>only counted twelve in each dormitory on his rounds that
night. How the new distribution was made is shown in
<a href="#fig_20">Fig. 20</a>.</p>

<p>Next night four more chums popped in for a snooze,
making a total of forty-four,
and again the master was
bamboozled by the following
readjustment (<a href="#fig_21">Fig. 21</a>).</p>

<p>History is silent upon the
subject of the arrangement at
the breakfast-tables.</p>

the initial arrangement, allow
them to work the rest out for themselves.</p>

<p>Arrange fourteen matches as in <a href="#fig_22">Fig. 22</a>, and tell your

without disturbing the others, and replace one in any
position they may choose in such a way as to show what

<p>Arrange eight matches as shown in <a href="#fig_24">Fig. 24</a>, and state
that this enclosure, formed by eight hurdles, is supposed
to hold one hundred sheep. Ask your friends how many
<span id="pg_67" class="page_anchor">67 </span>more hurdles would be required to enable the enclosure
to contain two hundred sheep? The reply is generally
eight more, and your friends will be surprised to learn that
only two more hurdles are required—one at each end
across the enclosure. Three hurdles being moved to
admit of the introduction of the additional two, the pen
will, of course, be doubled in size.</p>

<h3 id="post_and_rail_puzzle">POST AND RAIL PUZZLE</h3>

<p>Put the following question to the company: Supposing
there was a tunnel through a hill and a post and rail fence
was constructed through it, and another fence was made
exactly above it, over the hill, how many more posts would
be required for the latter route, supposing they were the
same distance apart by both routes?</p>

<p>After several calculations have been made you can
astonish the company by telling them that exactly the
same number of posts would be required for both routes,
which you can prove by making a rough sketch of the
diagram, <a href="#fig_25">Fig. 25</a>, and placing matches on it to represent
the posts.</p>

<h3 id="a_good_after-dinner_trick">A GOOD AFTER-DINNER TRICK</h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="first_word">Procure</span> an egg, an apple, an orange, and two dozen
nuts. Place the latter on a plate, and request three
persons during your absence from the room to each pocket
one of the three former, asserting that you will eventually
state in whose pockets the different articles are to be
found. On returning to the room present to one of the
persons you have asked to assist you one nut, to a second
person two nuts, and to the third three nuts, which will of
course leave eighteen nuts on the plate. You must mentally
name the person to whom you gave one nut “number
one,” to the person holding two nuts “number two,” and
the one who has three nuts “number three.”</p>

<p>Announce your intention of again leaving the room,
and request your three assistants to help themselves during
your absence to nuts as follows—the one holding the apple
to take the same number of nuts you presented him with,
the one who has the egg to twice as many as you gave
him, and the holder of the orange to four times as many
as he originally received.</p>

<p>Impress on them that the number of nuts they take
must be <i>in addition</i> to those they already hold.</p>

<span id="pg_69" class="page_anchor">69 </span>

<p>On returning to the room you glance at the nuts remaining
in the plate and at once call for the egg, apple, and
orange from their respective holders.</p>

<div class="center">
<span class="title">Explanation.</span>
</div>

<p>You must memorise the following Latin words: Attento,
Beato, Cantores, Erocat, Fortasse, Glossema, numbering
them 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 7. The initials of these words, it
will be observed, are the first six letters of the alphabet,
omitting D, which is not required; A, of course, standing
for Apple, E for Egg, and O for Orange.</p>

<p>On returning to the room after your second absence
count the number of nuts remaining on plate, refer to the
Latin words, and you have the key. Supposing there are
only two nuts left, take the second word, Beato, and reject
the consonants, when the vowels will remain in proper
order, E, A, O. The E being first shows the egg is in the
pocket of the person whom you have designated as
“number one.” The A being second indicates “number
two” has the apple, and the O, the third letter, means
“number three” holds the orange.</p>

<p>Supposing there are seven nuts left, take the seventh
word, Glossema, reject the consonants as before, and pick
out the vowels, O, E, A, which proves “number one”
person holds the orange, “number two” the egg, and
“number three” the apple, and so on with the other Latin
words, the remaining number of nuts always indicating
the word from which you are to select the vowels. This
trick may be repeated <i>ad lib.</i> without fear of detection.</p>

<p>Obtain a piece of tape, or string, about three feet in

ring and the ends of the loop over the thumbs of a friend
(<a href="#fig_26">Fig. 26</a>).</p>

</div>

<p>Take hold of the tape with your left forefinger at A and
pull it forward and down; with your right forefinger pull
the tape at B, from underneath, forward and upward, which
will cause the two parts to cross each other. Then with
your right forefinger and thumb place the tape B over the
thumb D; move the ring toward D and with your right
forefinger and thumb take the tape at C from underneath
and carry it also over the thumb D. Take hold of the ring
and pull it gently, as you slip your left forefinger out of the
loop A, when it will at once be released without the tape
leaving either thumb.</p>

<p>Give a person two half-crowns and request him to hold
them horizontally between the tips of his thumb and finger
of his right hand, the coins touching each other. Then
request him to drop the lower coin in his left hand and
you will tell him which side will come uppermost. First
note which side of the coin is underneath when you place
them in position, for that will be the uppermost side when
it reaches his left hand. The lower coin will turn completely
over in the act of falling: nothing can prevent it.
The distance between the hands should be from fourteen to
sixteen inches.</p>

<h3 id="a_scissors_feat">A SCISSORS FEAT</h3>

<p>Hold a pair of scissors on the first two joints of your
little fingers with your palms upward, their blades pointing
to the floor (<a href="#fig_27">Fig. 27</a>). Then throw the points over toward
you, turning your hands at the same time and bringing
<span id="pg_72" class="page_anchor">72 </span>your knuckles back to back, the scissors standing out
straight from you (<a href="#fig_28">Fig. 28</a>).</p>

<p>Fig. 28.</p>
</div>

<p>I have never seen any one accomplish this simple feat
until they learned the secret. When you throw the scissors
over on the palms of your hands, with their points toward
your chest, allow the blades to rest there for an instant with
the tips of your little fingers touching your palms through
the <ins title="Note: “scissor’s” in the original">scissors’</ins> bows; then bring the backs of your fingers
together with your hands closed and the points of the
scissors outward. The uninitiated, instead of allowing the
bows to slip to the points of the little fingers, hold them
tight on the second joints and, of course, fail.</p>

<h3 id="another_trick_with_a_pair_of_scissors">ANOTHER TRICK WITH A PAIR OF
SCISSORS</h3>

<p>This trick consists of fastening the scissors securely to
the back of a chair with a piece of string and then removing
them without cutting or untying the string. First
make a loop of a piece of string about two feet in length
and pass the double end through one of the bows and the
<span id="pg_73" class="page_anchor">73 </span>two loose ends through the loop and pull tight. Next pass
the two single ends through the other bow of the scissors
and tie them to the back of the chair. The puzzle is
how to remove them, which is simple enough when you
know how. Loosen the loop and draw it upwards and pass
it through the other bow, and then over both bows and
points, when the scissors will be free.</p>

<h3 id="an_indestructible_cigarette_paper">AN INDESTRUCTIBLE CIGARETTE<ins title="Note: “-” in the original"> </ins>PAPER</h3>

<p>Take three cigarette<ins title="Note: “-” in the original"> </ins>papers, fold one up into a very
small square, and paste it lightly on the top right corner of
the second paper. The third paper roll lengthwise, and
conceal it in your ear. Show the first paper between both
thumbs and fingers, your right thumb on the pasted corner,
then proceed to tear it up into squares, placing the pieces
in front of each other before tearing again. When it is in
pieces about the size of the pasted square, under the shelter
of your left hand, with its back to the audience, separate
the pieces from the square and hold the latter up between
your right thumb and finger. Then, pretending to moisten
your left forefinger on your tongue, slip the pieces in your
mouth and conceal them there, and carefully unfold the
square held in the other hand, when the paper will appear
to have been restored. You then roll the paper length
wise, and say, “I will swallow it.” Put it in your mouth
and pretend to do so. Putting your left hand to your ear,
say, “I will now reproduce from my ear.” Pull out the
paper concealed there very carefully, and as you turn to
<span id="pg_74" class="page_anchor">74 </span>lay it on your table allow the pieces in your mouth to drop
into your hand.</p>

<h3 id="to_cut_an_apple_in_two_with_your_finger">TO CUT AN APPLE IN TWO WITH
YOUR FINGER</h3>

<p>With a needle and strong thread take a stitch of about
half an inch in its side, leaving several inches of the thread
hanging from where you puncture it. Reinserting the
needle in the hole it made coming out, take another stitch of
half an inch, and again reinsert the needle where it came
out. Take similar stitches all round the apple until the
needle comes out of the first hole made, and then cross the
two ends of the thread and pull them steadily until all the
thread comes out of the hole. The apple is now cut through,
although the skin does not show it.</p>

<p>Slip this apple in your pocket, and during dessert select
an apple as much like the prepared one as possible. Having
previously placed your serviette over your knees, with the
prepared apple in it, drop the apple just selected and pick
up the former with your right hand while you turn your plate
over with your left hand. Putting the apple on its side on
the inverted plate, laying your forefinger on the apple you
give the former a smart blow with your right fist, when the
apple will fall in two pieces.</p>

<h3 id="a_trick_with_dominoes">A TRICK WITH DOMINOES</h3>

<p>Take a full set of dominoes—twenty-eight pieces—turn
them face downward on the table; shuffle them thoroughly;
<span id="pg_75" class="page_anchor">75 </span>then tell the company to turn them over and match them
in the ordinary way, while you take a seat at the other end
of the room with your back to the table. They can blindfold
you if they wish. As soon as all the pieces are matched
you call out the numbers shown at the two ends of the row.
Return to the table, turn the dominoes over again, shuffle
them as before with the right hand; again turn your back,
and call out the end numbers. You can repeat this any
number of times without detection, unless some one
should count the pieces and find only twenty-seven. Each
time you have shuffled them you have dropped a piece
concealed in your right hand, and extracted and palmed
another. One piece taken from a set of dominoes invariably
indicates by its numbers the numbers at the two ends
of a row when the pieces are all properly matched.</p>

<h3 id="an_escape">AN ESCAPE</h3>

<p>Ask some one to tie your wrists together with a handkerchief,
and then to pass a cord between your arms behind
your tied wrists, and hold the ends securely. Have
towel or cloth thrown over your hands, and after a very
brief interval tell the person who holds the ends of the
cord to pull. When he does so, the latter will pass from
your hands and fall on the floor. You remove the cloth,
and show that your wrists are still tied together.</p>

<p><span class="title">Explanation.</span>—When your hands are covered, move
your elbows out, which will separate your wrists, push the
second finger of your right hand between them, and with
it pull the bight of the cord through the bandage round
<span id="pg_76" class="page_anchor">76 </span>your wrists, slip it over one hand, and when your assistant
pulls the cord it will pass off clear of your hands.</p>

<h3 id="cigarette_papers_and_serviettes">CIGARETTE PAPERS AND SERVIETTES</h3>

<p>Screw three cigarette papers up into pellets and cover
each of them with a folded serviette. Then lift the serviette
on your right with your left hand (to show that the pellet
is still there) and transfer it to your right, holding it with
your thumb on top and fingers underneath, and re-cover
the pellet. As you do this nip the pellet between the tips
of your first and second fingers in such a way that it does
not show in front of them as you withdraw your hand palm
upwards. Then raise the centre serviette with your left
hand, transfer it to your right, as before, and re-cover the
pellet, and as you do so, drop the pellet concealed between
your fingers under it. Then raise the third serviette with
your left hand, transfer it to your right, re-cover the pellet,
and, in doing so, nip the latter between your fingers, as you
did the first one. Then say: “There are three pellets on
the table covered by serviettes. I command the one here
(pointing to the one on your left) to travel invisibly to the
centre serviette.” Turn the serviette over, and show the
pellet has gone. Then lift the centre serviette with your
left hand, and show the two pellets under it. Transfer it
to your right hand, and, in replacing it, drop the concealed
pellet. Then say: “We have now two pellets under the
centre serviette, and one under this one” (pointing to the
one on your left). “I command this one to join its
fellows.” Lift the serviette as you speak, and show the
<span id="pg_77" class="page_anchor">77 </span>pellet has gone; lift up the centre serviette, and the three
pellets will be found together.</p>

<h3 id="four_cigarette_papers">FOUR CIGARETTE PAPERS</h3>

<p>This is a variation of the previous trick. Roll up five
cigarette papers into pellets. Conceal one at the root of
the left thumb, and form a square with the others on the
table. Show your hands empty (the concealed pellet will
not be observed if properly held), and cross your hands
over the pellets on the table. With the tips of your right
fore and second fingers nip one of the pellets on your left,
and at the same time drop the pellet concealed in your
left hand between the two on your right. Move both
hands away quickly, and one of the pellets on your left
will appear to have travelled invisibly under your right
hand. Again cross your hands, passing your right hand
under the left, and as you do so drop the pellet concealed
between your fingers, covering it at once with the left
hand. Then nip the remaining pellet with your right first
and second fingers, as before, and, on lifting your hands,
all four pellets will appear on your right. You can get rid
of the remaining pellet by dropping it on the floor, or on
your lap if you are sitting at the table.</p>

<p>A piece of earthenware is given, upon which a spectator
is requested to write his initials with a piece of charcoal
supplied. The correct preparation of this charcoal was
conveyed to me by a Hindoo, and is as follows: Procure a
piece of boxwood or beech, the former for preference, place it
in the fire until reduced to a red glowing mass, remove it
with tongs and immediately place it into a thick jar and
cover up very tightly till cool.</p>

<p>The earthenware is taken by the performer and crushed
up under his heel. The spectator is then asked to wave
his right hand over the broken pieces, and upon the palm
being turned upwards the absolute initials in all detail are
found imprinted upon his hand.</p>

<p><span class="title">Presentation.</span>—Hand the piece of earthenware to the
spectator, together with the charcoal; request that his initials
shall be written on the earthenware in a space marked the
size of the tip of the index finger. After this has been
done, you take it back between the thumb and index finger
of the right hand, the finger over the initials exerting a firm
pressure which has the effect of transferring the writing to
the latter. Then place the earthenware under your heel
and crush it.</p>

<p>Now request the spectator to wave his right hand over
the pieces. After this has been done for a few seconds,
boldly take hold of the hand (your index finger firmly
pressing upon its palm) and suggest that the hand is not
quite over the pieces, suiting the action to the word by
slightly pulling the hand forward; this has the effect of re-transferring
<span id="pg_79" class="page_anchor">79 </span>the reversed initials on to the spectator’s palm,
to be discovered a little later upon the hand being turned
over.</p>

<h3 id="the_elusive_match-a_capital_impromptu_trick">THE ELUSIVE MATCH—A CAPITAL
IMPROMPTU TRICK</h3>

<p><span class="title">Effect.</span>—A match apparently thrown away persists in
reappearing in closed hand.</p>

<p><span class="title">Requisites.</span>—A box of ordinary safety matches, together
with an extra match top, broken off about half an inch
long.</p>

<p><span class="title">Presentation.</span>—First conceal the extra match top
between the tips of the index and second finger of the
right hand. Now give the box of matches to a spectator,
and request that the tops of three of the matches be broken
off about half an inch long and handed to you. You then
place these upon the table and proceed to pick them up
one at a time with the right hand, and throw them into the
left (each time closing that hand) as follows: The first is
thrown in quite fairly, the second one is also thrown in
but is secretly accompanied by the one which you have
previously concealed at the finger-tips, the third one you
pick up and apparently throw away, but really retaining it
at the finger-tips as above mentioned. You now open the
left hand and throw three match tops on to the table
instead of the supposed two; apparently the one thrown
away has secretly travelled back to the left hand. This
trick can be repeated about three times without fear of
detection, as you always have a fourth match top in readiness
at the finger-tips. Properly worked it proves a very bewildering
little trick.</p>
